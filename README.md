<img src="BERT_diagrams.png" height=500px>

Two guided projects from Coursera I have implemented using BERT pretrained models.

1. The first guided project is [Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow).
2. The second guided project is [Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT](https://www.coursera.org/projects/sentiment-analysis-bert).

>The **Data** folder contains the dataset used for the second guided project.
